# The Native Asset Management Financial Revolution

Definition:

1. Feral: In its most basic sense, feral refers to something that has reverted back to a wild or untamed state after being domesticated or controlled. This term is often used in the context of animals, particularly those that have escaped captivity and adapted to living independently in the wilderness.

2. Meaning: The word "feral" can also be applied metaphorically to describe human behavior or actions. In this sense, it implies a return to a more natural or primal state, often characterized by independence, self-reliance, and a rejection of societal norms or expectations. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of financial freedom, where individuals seek to break free from the constraints of traditional banking systems and establish their own autonomous financial structures.

3. How it's used in a sentence: "The feral cat had adapted well to life outside the shelter, thriving on its newfound independence."

4. The meaning of how it is an analogy for us freeing ourselves from financial bondage: Just as a feral animal has escaped captivity and learned to survive independently, individuals who embrace the concept of feral finance are seeking to break free from the traditional banking system's control over their financial lives. By creating their own autonomous financial structures, they can regain control over their money and live more freely, much like the feral cat that has adapted to life outside the shelter.
