      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-native-asset-management-financial-revolution&#34;&gt;The Native Asset Management Financial Revolution&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Definition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Feral: In its most basic sense, feral refers to something that has reverted back to a wild or untamed state after being domesticated or controlled. This term is often used in the context of animals, particularly those that have escaped captivity and adapted to living independently in the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meaning: The word &amp;ldquo;feral&amp;rdquo; can also be applied metaphorically to describe human behavior or actions. In this sense, it implies a return to a more natural or primal state, often characterized by independence, self-reliance, and a rejection of societal norms or expectations. This concept is particularly relevant in the context of financial freedom, where individuals seek to break free from the constraints of traditional banking systems and establish their own autonomous financial structures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
